# NotesTree
If you tired of hundred tabs in Notepad++, this plugin brings consistency and availability to your notes in pretty convenient way.
The plugin adds ability to write tree structure global notes in such formats as `txt`, `md`, `json`, `xml`, `yaml`, `sql` or `http`.
The plugin brings you the way to keep `Dockerfile` or `docker_compose` templates, `java`, `python` or `kotlin` files, 
and it also supports [plum](https://plantuml.com/en/) and [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)
 diagrams.

Intellij idea also provides you to possibility to directly from the plugin run some of these notes like http files,
sql scripts or docker_compose templates, it is really convenient and useful during development.
